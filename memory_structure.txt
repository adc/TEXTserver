Requirements:

  Users should see other users updating cells
  at their current location in real time.
  
  No limit on num of clients
  
  Client data structures should not be aware of other clients
--------
  
Idea 1:

Use shared memory segments to represent locations.

SZ_Y = 30; SZ_X = 60 = 1800 cells per location.

Although cells represent 1 character, they are currently
4 bytes to make room for colors and other things. Maybe unicode 
in the future.

1800 * 4 = 7200 bytes per location.

1 page = 4096 bytes. This means 2 pages of memory
are required per location with 992 bytes left over for
overhead data structures. 

overhead:
4-byte  last_modified counter  which holds the timestamp of the last update
4-byte  last-accessed counter ??

4* 4 bytes for adjacent locations
  up, down, left, right

4 byte x coordinate
4 byte y coordinate
...

Extra data structures:

  splay tree of recently accessed locations
  for efficient memory access.
